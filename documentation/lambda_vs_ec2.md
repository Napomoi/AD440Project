EC2 is known to provide outstanding security.
Use Cases: When to use AWS Lambda?
_#1. Low complex code
Lambda is a perfect choice to execute code with minimal variables and 3rd party dependencies. It can process easy tasks containing low complex code in a streamlined manner.
_#2. Shorter executing time
Lambda is suitable for executing tasks that are occasional and can be executed within minutes.
_#3. Infrequent traffic
Businesses loathe it when servers sit idle, and they still have to pay for it. The pay-per-function model can help them in significantly cutting down their computing cost.
#4. Real-time processing
Paired with AWS Kinesis, Lambda works best for real-time batch processing.
#5. Scheduled CRON jobs
AWS Lambda functions serve well for scheduled events to function at a fixed scheduled time.
